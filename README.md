# Pacniff:

Packet sniffing is a method of monitoring data traffic on a network. It involves intercepting and logging traffic, including sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and personal details. Packet sniffing is commonly used by hackers and crackers to gain access to a network. It is also used by network administrators to detect and troubleshoot network problems. Packet sniffing can also be used by network security professionals to detect and prevent unauthorized access or attacks on a network.

- I need to first decide what type of project I want to create. There are many different types of packet sniffers, including connection-oriented sniffers, network monitoring systems, and application-level analyzers. I need to choose the programming language and tools I will use. Popular languages for developing packet sniffers include C/C++, Python, and Java. Additionally, I will need access to a packet-sniffing library or API, such as libpcap or WinPcap.

- Once I have chosen the language and tools, I need to develop the code for my packet sniffer. This will involve setting up network sockets, configuring the protocol, and developing the packet-capturing functions. Additionally, I will need to create a parser to extract relevant information from the captured packets, such as source and destination IP addresses and ports.

- Finally, I will need to test my project. This will involve setting up a test network, running tests to ensure that my sniffer is capturing the right information, and verifying that the display format is correct. Once I have finished testing, I will have a working packet sniffer that is able to capture and analyze network traffic.
